                            <p>Downtown Yangon is the home of the Sule Pagoda, a place of peace and meditation in the middle of the busy city. It’s
                            believed to be more than 2,000 years old. It figures high on the list of Myanmar destinations especially among devotees
                            because it houses a hair relic of Buddha.
                            The Sule Pagoda is often overlooked by tourists but it should figure in your Myanmar travels because it’s one of the
                            only points of interest in this part of Yangon. </p>

                            if you love to hike. The extinct volcano is not just magnificent to look at in itself but it’s topped by the Popa
                            Taungkalat Monastery that’s perched on an outcrop. 777 steps will take you all the way to the top and reward you with

                            the Bagan Archeological Zone that’s spread across 26 square miles. The best way to take in the entirety of this
                            breathtaking city is to hop into a hot air balloon and fly over it. The rides take place in the wee hours of the
                            morning. Carry a good camera so you can take photos of the monuments from above. </p>

                            encrusting the top of the stupa, it’s an architectural wonder that will take your breath away. If there’s only one
