                   <p>Myanmar is country rich in history, culture and tradition. Itâ€™s midway between undergoing urbanization so that when you
                visit, you see an incredible mix of modern and old. Pagodas seem scattered across the landscape and nowhere is this more
                apparent than in Bagan. They even grace balancing rocks and the center of cities. But, while pagodas are some of the
                biggest attractions here, the country also boasts stunning natural landscapes and tourist-friendly beaches. Along with
                this, it is a popular place among the Buddha followers as it is home to several Buddhist temples. </p>

        <h1>Transportation</h1>
        <br>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <strong>Yangon International Airport (RGN):</strong>Located in Yangon, the largest city and former capital
                of Myanmar, Yangon International Airport is the primary gateway for international travelers. It offers flights
                to major cities in Asia and beyond.
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>
                <strong>Naypyidaw International Airport (NYT):</strong> Naypyidaw International Airport serves the capital
                city of Naypyidaw. While it primarily handles domestic flights, there are also limited international
                connections.
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>
                <strong>Railway Network:</strong> Myanmar has a railway network that connects major cities and towns,
                offering an alternative mode of transportation for tourists. However, the rail infrastructure may not be as
                developed or comfortable as in some other countries.
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>
                <strong>Boat Cruises:</strong> In certain regions like Inle Lake and the Irrawaddy River, boat cruises offer
                a unique and scenic way to explore the landscapes and cultural sites of Myanmar.
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>
                <strong>Local Transportation:</strong> Within cities, tourists can use taxis, ride-sharing services,
                trishaws (three-wheeled bicycles), and local buses to get around.
            </li>
        </ol>
        
        <h1>Leaders</h1>
        <br>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <strong>Aung San:</strong> Aung San is often considered the father of modern Myanmar. He played a crucial role
                in negotiating independence from British colonial rule and was instrumental in forming the Panglong Agreement,
                which laid the foundation for Myanmar's ethnic unity. Tragically, he was assassinated in 1947, just months
                before Myanmar gained independence.
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>
                <strong>Ne Win:</strong> Ne Win was a military leader who seized power in a coup in 1962, establishing a
                socialist military government. His rule was marked by economic mismanagement, isolationism, and
                authoritarianism. Ne Win's policies led to economic stagnation and widespread poverty in Myanmar.
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>
                <strong>Aung San Suu Kyi:</strong> Aung San Suu Kyi is a Nobel Peace Prize laureate and the leader of the
                National League for Democracy (NLD). She emerged as a prominent figure in Myanmar's pro-democracy movement
                during the late 1980s and early 1990s. Despite being placed under house arrest for many years by the military
                junta, she remained a symbol of resistance and was eventually released in 2010. Aung San Suu Kyi led the NLD to
                victory in the 2015 general elections, becoming the de facto leader of Myanmar. However, her international
                reputation has been tarnished due to her handling of the Rohingya crisis.
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>
                <strong>Min Aung Hlaing:</strong> General Min Aung Hlaing is the current Commander-in-Chief of the Myanmar Armed
                Forces (Tatmadaw). He gained significant influence following the military coup in 2021, where he ousted the
                civilian government led by Aung San Suu Kyi. Since then, he has been the de facto leader of the country,
                overseeing a period of widespread unrest and protests against military rule.
            </li>
        </ol>

        <h1>History of Myanmar</h1>
        <br>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <strong>Early Civilizations:</strong> Myanmar's history dates back to the early civilizations along the
                Irrawaddy River valley, such as the Pyu city-states and the Mon kingdoms. These civilizations flourished between
                the 1st century BCE and the 9th century CE, leaving behind impressive archaeological sites and cultural
                artifacts.
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>
                <strong>Pagan Empire (9th to 13th centuries):</strong> The Pagan Empire, also known as the Kingdom of Pagan, was
                a powerful and influential Buddhist empire that unified much of modern-day Myanmar from the 9th to the 13th
                centuries. During this period, thousands of Buddhist temples and pagodas were built across the plains of Bagan
                (formerly Pagan), creating one of the most remarkable archaeological sites in Southeast Asia.
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>
                <strong>Mongol Invasions and Decline:</strong> The Pagan Empire eventually declined due to internal strife and
                external pressures, including invasions by the Mongols in the 13th century. After the fall of Pagan, Myanmar
                fragmented into smaller kingdoms and city-states.
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>
                <strong>British Colonial Rule (19th to mid-20th century):</strong> Myanmar became a British colony in three
                stages between 1824 and 1886. British colonial rule brought significant changes to Myanmar's economy, society,
                and politics. It also led to the growth of nationalist movements, including the Thakin movement, which advocated
                for independence from British rule.
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>
                <strong>Transition to Democracy:</strong> In 2011, Myanmar began a process of political and economic reforms,
                leading to the gradual transition from military rule to a semi-civilian government. Aung San Suu Kyi, leader of
                the National League for Democracy (NLD), became a prominent figure in Myanmar's political landscape.
            </li>
        </ol>

            <li>
                <strong>Chinese Domination:</strong> Vietnam experienced centuries of Chinese domination, with periods of
                resistance and independence struggles. Despite Chinese influence, Vietnamese culture and identity remained

                <strong>Portuguese Colonization:</strong> East Timor was colonized by Portugal in the 16th century and

            <li>
                <strong>Indonesian Occupation:</strong> Following Portugal's withdrawal in 1975, East Timor was invaded and
